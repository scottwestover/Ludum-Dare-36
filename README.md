# Ludum-Dare-36
This is a platformer game that few others and I worked on for the Ludum Dare 36 Game Jam. The theme was ancient technology.

The game was built using Phaser, audio is all original from our team, most of the art was that was used is from opengameart.org (a few sprites where created in Piskel).

The game is a 2D platformer.
